VFold API library
=============

A project still in development with great potential for bringing developers together to create and customize their own set of application components (Folders, Widgets, Tools and Desktops)

Features:
-------

* ### WebGL enabled
 
    A custom graphics engine implemented in the vfold platform for a great performance increase.

* ### Your Components

    There is a nice API for you to develop your components quickly and easily. The library is still lacking, but more work to come!

* ### Workspaces

    A container of all defined components belonging to it. In workspaces, you keep things tidy.

* ### The Dashboard

    VFOLD's default workspace for viewing and managing your entire platform. There is work yet to come on this area. Still in early development stage.

Compile:
-------

Simply run the compiler.js on nodejs using the uglify-js module. The compiler is located at the project's root folder and requires two arguments. One for the source folder and the other for the output path.

Libraries used:
------------

* [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/)
* [Doctrine - Object Relational Mapper] (http://www.doctrine-project.org/)
